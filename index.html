				<h3 id = 'aboutUsTitle'class="margin-bottom-sm heading"><a href="#nav" class="pageUp">About us</a></h3>
				<p id="aboutUsInfo">Teen Tech Hubâ€™s goal is to empower youth and gather community resources in order to nurture a sound learning environment. We partner with Silicon Valley organizations like Teens in Tech and HackStar Academy to assist with course curriculums and mentorships. Our program will equip our students with the necessary tools to change lives and communities.
				<br>
				<br>
				Teen Tech Hub participants will be divided into 2 separate groups of 15. Each group will meet twice a week separately. On Saturdays the groups will meet as a whole and the participants will receive instruction and mentoring from mentors in coding, design, and social media marketing. Each session will last for 90 minutes.
				<br>
				<br>
				During the 9-month program, the teens will go through team building exercises where they will be able to share the issues they feel are unique to them.
				<br>
				<br>
				Once the youth graduate from the program, they will be encouraged to come back and help the next class. This will further increase their self-esteem, purpose as well as sense of community</p>
