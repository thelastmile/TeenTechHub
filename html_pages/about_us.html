				</div>

				<p class="padding-bottom-med">Teen Tech Hub is a non-profit organization with a mission to educate, enrich and empower inner city youth. In over 100 of our countries largest cities, over 50 percent of 9th grade students in high minority schools fail to graduate from high school within four years. With overcrowded classrooms and the elimination of vital after school programs, these young men and women become susceptible to the influence of gangs, drugs, and other negative influences.</p>

				<p class="padding-bottom-med">Teen Tech Hub's goal is to gather community resources in order to nurture a positive learning environment, to enrich the lives of all participants, and to empower young men and women to fulfill their dreams. Our students become leaders in our communities, helping to address problems in our communities and closing the knowledge gap among poor minorities.</p>

				<p class="padding-bottom-sm">Located in Richmond, California, in the shadow of one of the worlds largest tech areas, Teen Tech Hub partners with organizations like Teens in Tech and HackStar Academy in order to provide our students with quality mentoring and outstanding internship opportunities. Many of our partners offer full-time employment and career counseling. Through these partnerships, Teen Tech Hub will train and equip young men and women to be leaders, not just in their communities, but in their lives.</p>
