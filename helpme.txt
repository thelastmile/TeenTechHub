I need help with the game. I'm having a problem getting the character to move smoothly. I hit the arrow key and hold it down, she moves once, but then there is a lag until the next move, then it's fine. How do I get that second move to be move, rather than delaying.

Recreate by holding down either left or right arrow keys. Notice the lag in between the first move and the second.
