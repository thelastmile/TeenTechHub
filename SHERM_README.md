The area of my responsibility for this first week was to provide a basic layout 
for the <main> section of the page, specifically, COURSES and ABOUT US.

I completed the image layout and "lables" above the images.

Of course this is rudimentory work, I didn't expect the layout to be the actual 
content. However, I appreciate the opportunity to contribute my nascent abilities to
the project.
